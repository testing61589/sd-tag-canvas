# Image Tag Editor

A PySide6-based application for editing images and managing associated tags with painting, cropping, and zoom capabilities.

## File Structure

The application has been modularized into the following files:

### Core Files
- **main.py** - Application entry point with command line argument support
- **config.py** - Configuration constants and settings
- **main_window.py** - Main application window (ImageTagEditor class)
- **image_canvas.py** - Custom image display widget with painting, cropping, and zoom (ImageCanvas class)

## Module Descriptions

### config.py
Contains all application constants and configuration settings:

- Supported image file extensions
- Default paint settings (color, brush size)
- Zoom settings (min/max zoom, zoom steps)
- UI dimensions and limits
- File format settings

### image_canvas.py
The ImageCanvas class provides:

- Image display with scaling, centering, and zoom support
- Paint overlay system for non-destructive editing
- Crop selection with draggable handles
- Zoom functionality with mouse wheel support
- Mouse interaction handling for painting, cropping, and zooming
- Coordinate conversion between screen and image space
- Scroll area support for zoomed images

### main_window.py
The ImageTagEditor class provides:

- Main application window and UI layout
- File browser and image navigation
- Paint tool controls (color picker, brush size, etc.)
- Zoom controls (zoom in/out, reset, fit to window)
- Tags editing interface
- Menu system and keyboard shortcuts
- Image and tag saving functionality
- Support for initial folder loading
- Scroll area for image display

### main.py
Application entry point that:

- Parses command line arguments using argparse
- Validates folder paths and handles errors gracefully
- Creates the QApplication instance
- Sets application metadata
- Creates and shows the main window with optional initial folder
- Starts the event loop

## Benefits of This Structure

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each file has a specific responsibility
- **Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
- **Reusability**: Components can be imported and used independently
- **Testability**: Individual modules can be tested in isolation
- **Configuration Management**: All settings centralized in config.py
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without cluttering existing files
- **Command Line Integration**: Supports automation and batch workflows
- **User Experience**: Smooth zoom and navigation controls

## Error Handling

The application includes robust error handling for:

- Invalid or non-existent folder paths
- Permission denied errors
- Malformed file paths
- Missing dependencies
- Image loading failures
- Zoom operations on invalid images

When errors occur with command line arguments, the application will:

- Display a clear error message
- Continue running without the problematic folder
- Allow the user to open a folder manually

## Future Enhancements

This modular structure makes it easy to add new features:

- Additional image editing tools (blur, sharpen, filters, etc.)
- Plugin system for custom tools
- Different export formats
- Undo/redo functionality
- Batch processing capabilities
- Additional command line options (e.g., --start-with-file)
- Configuration file support
- Advanced zoom features (zoom to selection, zoom to fit width/height)
- Pan functionality for zoomed images
- Thumbnail navigation panel
